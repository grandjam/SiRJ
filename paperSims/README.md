# Description
The files in this folder contain the model code, simulation scripts, and data files for the simulation reported in **Grand, J.A. (in press). A general response process theory for situational judgment tests. *Journal of Applied Psychology***. The environInits.R, personInits.R, SJTInits.R, and modelFuncs.R script files are identical to those described in base SiRJ. The remaining script files are slightly adapted to accomodate the different response process proposed to be used by respondents when evalauting SJT response optionsn items based on similarity in actions versus perceived consequences as described in the paper. More specifically:
1. **answerSJT_rsp.R** & **answerSJT_rspCxt.R** -- these scripts are identical except for the way in which Step 5 of the SiRJ evaluation process on lines 36-43 are carried out. The answerSJT_rspCxt.R file is identical to the answerSJT.R file in the base model of SiRJ such that respondents compute the degree of similarity between the perceived consequences of their most likely/preferred behavior and the perceived consequences of each response option for an SJT item. In the answerSJT_rsp.R file, this behavior is changed such that respondents compute the degree of similarity between their most likely/preferred behavior and the actual behaviors described in each response option for an SJT item. 
2. **SiRJSim_compareRsp_sitAbs.R**, **SiRJSim_compareRsp_sitPres.R**, **SiRJSim_compareRspCxt_sitAbs.R**, &  **SiRJSim_compareRspCxt_sitPres.R** -- contains the files for running simulated test takers with varying levels of expertise and experience strength under conditions when respondents compare actions (compareRsp) versus consequences (compareRspCxt) and when SJT does (sitPres) and does not (sitAbs) contain item stems.

The default settings specified in the provided simulation script files is to **run the simulation in parallel on multiple cores/processors distributed across different computers.** To change this behavior and run the simulation across multiple cores on a single computer, uncomment lines 10-11 and comment out lines 14-15. Additionally, the protocols for saving the data in lines 57-58 should be updated by assigning the `id` variable on line 16 to a unique identifier for the simulation run.

# Simulation data
## Overview
The final simulation design used a fully crossed 4 (experience strength, between) x 5 (expertise level, between) x 2 (item stem, within: situation-present, situation-absent) x 2 (evaluation criterion, within: response consequences, response behavior) mixed factorial design. The simulation results reported in the paper were based on a total of 10,000 unique respondents (i.e., 500 for each unique combination of experience strength x expertise level), resulting in a total of 1.6 million simulated SJT choices (10,000 respondents x 20 SJT items x 2 response selections per item (most effective and least effective) x 4 within-respondent conditions). To speed up the compute time for running the simulations, a total of 100 simulation jobs were conducted -- 25 for each for the 4 evaluation criterion x item stem combinations.
## Data files
The final data files generated by the simulations are provided in the folders labeled **rawDat** and **finalDat**. 
The rawDat folder contains the following items:
1. **condsDat_compRsp_sitAbs1-25.RData** -- raw data for the compare response behavior x situation-absent conditions; each file contains data for 400 respondents
2. **condsDat_compRsp_sitPres1-25.RData** -- raw data for the compare response behavior x situation-present conditions; each file contains data for 400 respondents
3. **condsDat_compRspCxt_sitAbs1-25.RData** -- raw data for the compare response consequences x situation-absent conditions; each file contains data for 400 respondents
4. **condsDat_compRspCxt_sitPres1-25.RData** -- raw data for the compare response consequences x situation-present conditions; each file contains data for 400 respondents
5. **conds_compRsp_sitAbs1-25.RData** -- the selected parameter values for the 400 respondents in each of the 25 compare response behavior x situation-absent simulations
6. **conds_compRsp_sitPres1-25.RData** -- the selected parameter values for the 400 respondents in each of the 25 compare response behavior x situation-present simulations
7. **conds_compRspCxt_sitAbs1-25.RData** -- the selected parameter values for the 400 respondents in each of the 25 compare response consequences x situation-absent simulations
8. **conds_compRspCxt_sitPres1-25.RData** -- the selected parameter values for the 400 respondents in each of the 25 compare response consequence x situation-present simulations
9. **dataExtract.R** -- R script for aggregating all simulation data into useful data files

The finalDat folder contains the following items:
1. **sirjRspEval.RData** -- a list object containing respondents' cumulative similarity judgments for each SJT item. Each list element is a three dimensional array with dimensions [iteration, response option, SJT item]
2. **sirjSJTEval.RData** -- a data frame containing summary information of respondents' selections on each SJT item
3. **figs.R** -- R script for replicating all figures reported in the final manuscript; requires sirjRspEval.RData and sirjSJTEval.RData to be loaded in the R environment
