# Description
The files in this folder contain the model code, simulation scripts, and data files for the simulation reported in CITATION REDACTED. The environInits.R, personInits.R, SJTInits.R, and answerSJT.R script files are identical to those described in base SiRJ. The remaining script files are slightly adapted to accomodate the different response process proposed to be used by respondents in the situation-absent versus situation-present conditions described in the paper. More specifically:
1. **modelFuncs.R** -- contains same functions as base SiRJ, except that the function representing the conditional reasoning processes reflected in base SiRJ is removed.
2. **createSimInits.R** -- contains code for creating the same SJT items used in the simulations reported in the paper
3. **readItemSitAbsent.R** & **readItemSitPresent.R** -- contains the `readItem` function used to represent the conditional reasoning process. The `readItem` function in the readItemSitPresent.R file is identical the processes used in base SiRJ. The `readItem` function in the readItemSitAbsent.R file differs to allow respondents to complete the first conditional reasoning step in SiRJ when a situational item stem is not presented.
4. **SiRJSim_SitAbsent.R** & **SiRJSim_SitPresent.R** -- contains the files for running simulated test takers with varying levels of expertise and expertise under conditions when an SJT does and does not contain item stems (respectively).
5. **simInits.RData** -- loading this file in R will load the final initialization data used to run the simulations in the paper

The default settings specified in the two provided simulation script files (SirjSim_SitAbsent.R & SiRJSim_SitPresent.R) is to run the simulation in parallel on multiple cores/processors distributed across different computers. To change this behavior and run the simulation on multiple cores within a single computer, uncomment lines 9-10 and comment out lines 13-14. Additionally, the protocols for saving the data in lines 49-51 should be updated by assigning the `id` variable on line 49 to a unique identifier for the simulation run.

# Simulation data
## Overview
The simulation results reported in the paper were based on a total of 20,000 simulated respondents across a 4 (experience strength) x 5 (expertise level) x 2 (situation-absent, situation-present) fully crossed design. Thus, each cell in this design was comprised of 500 respondents. To speed up this compute time, a total of 20 simulation jobs were conducted -- 10 each for the situation-absent and situation-present conditions.
## Data files
The final data files generated by the simulations are provided in the folders labeled **rawDat** and **finalDat**. 
The rawDat folder contains the following items:
1. **condsDatNoSit1-10.RData** -- raw data for the situation-absent conditions; each file contains data for 1000 respondents
2. **condsDatSit1-10.RData** -- raw data for the situation-present conditions; each file contains data for 1000 respondents
3. **condsNoSit1-10.RData** -- the selected parameter values for the 1000 respondents in each of the 10 situation-absent simulations
4. **condsSit1-10.RData** -- the selected parameter values for the 1000 respondents in each of the 10 situation-present simulations
5. **dataExtract.R** -- R script for aggregating all simulation data into useful data files

The finalDat folder contains the following items:
1. **sirjRspEval.RData** -- a list object containing respondents' cumulative similarity judgments for each SJT item. Each list element is a three dimensional array with dimensions [iteration, response option, SJT item]
2. **sirjSJTEval.RData** -- a data frame containing summary information of respondents' selections on each SJT item
3. **figs.R** -- R script for replicating all figures reported in the final manuscript; requires sirjRspEval.RData and sirjSJTEval.RData to be loaded in the R environment
