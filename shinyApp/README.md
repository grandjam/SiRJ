# Description
An [interactive web application](https://grandjam.shinyapps.io/sirj) was constructed using R Shiny to accompany the final paper and facilitate communication of the SiRJ model. The **app.R** file is used to run the R Shiny application. Each subfolder contains the R code and functions for each page of the web application.
